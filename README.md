# WeatherStar

This project brings back the weather of the 90's, based on the Weather Channel's WeatherStar 4000 hardware system. It makes use of the [National Weather Service's API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to get the forecast for your area. There's also a few improvements compared to the original TWC system, including some better graphs and timestamping, and more useful SPC outlooks.

This project is based on the WS4000+ project by Matt Walsh, which you can find [here](https://github.com/netbymatt/ws4kp). My version has diverged significantly, as I find that project to be unbelievably overengineered.
